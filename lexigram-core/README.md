<hr/>

**Important note: This crate is still under development and shouldn't be considered stable yet (hence the 0.x version). I'm currently adding some documentation and examples, and refactoring the code.** 

# The `lexigram-code` Crate

This crate contains the minimal library required by the lexer/parser source code generated by the `lexigram` tool.

For now, check the lexigram crate for more information, or the [project GitHub](https://github.com/blueglyph/lexigram).
